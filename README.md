# üêö SeeShells

An AI-powered web app that helps users identify seashells from photos, using a custom-trained image recognition model deployed on Google Cloud Vertex AI.

<details>
The idea for this project came to me while I was going through my seashell collection, trying (and failing) to match each one with a guidebook full of thousands of shells. It was super slow and tedious! I figured why not just take a picture and let AI do the work?

So I decided to try building it. SeeShells started as a small side project to see if I could use AI to identify shells, while also experimenting with technologies/concepts I hadn‚Äôt worked with before but very much interested in (GCP, machine learning, and AI).

For the look of the app, I used Figma to draft up the prototype. I wanted to create something minimal but fun, so I went with custom styling. This project includes custom animations and SVG drawings.
